This api includes my web socket and node.js training sample codes. 

In this api , I used as technology WebSocket (socket.io) - Angular.js(for frontend) - Express.js ( for backend architecture)

I especially used socket.emit - socket.on - socket.broadcast and other socket.io methods to be able to create a good example of 
web socket technologies and a node.js api that works with web socket architecture.

# To Try Api
Firstly clone my repository by git clone https://github.com/ahmet-uzgor/live-balls-chat-api.git
And install requirements for api with "npm install"
after that start the api with "npm start"

# Api Details

In this api when you open the browser (http://localhost:3000) it asks a username for chat and it assign a color to this user
after login you can start to change your location and writing messages to other users
All location changing and messages that you wrote is broadcasted other users.

ENJOY WITH MY SIMPLE CHAT API.
