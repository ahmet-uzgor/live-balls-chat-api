This api includes my web socket and node.js training sample codes. 

In this api , I used as technology WebSocket (socket.io) - Angular.js(for frontend) - Express.js ( for backend architecture)

I especially used socket.emit - socket.on - socket.broadcast and other socket.io methods to be able to create a good example of 
web socket technologies and a node.js api that works with web socket architecture.
